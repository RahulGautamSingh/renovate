With the custom managers you can configure Renovate so it finds dependencies that are not detected by its other built-in package managers.

At present Renovate supports only one custom manager, that is regex manager.

Read the documentation for the [`regexManagers` config option](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#regexmanagers), to know more about them.

In future supports for more custom approaches will be added.
